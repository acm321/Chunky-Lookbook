## Tab 7: Materials

This tab allows you to change the material properties of any material you want. 

Emittance determines how much light each block emits (the color emitted depends on the color of the block). Here I've made water into an emitter:

Specularity determines how reflective something is. Zero means low reflectivity...:

And one gives you a mirror-like surface:

The index of refraction determines how transparent blocks distort light passing through them. Here's water with a low IoR:

Here's a higher IoR. As the difference in IoR between air and water increases, the [critical angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection#Critical_angle) gets smaller and smaller, and the amount of light reflected off the air/water boundary is increased:
