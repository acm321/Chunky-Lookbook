## Welcome to the Chunky Lookbook

Chunky is made by llbit. Here is the [main Chunky website](http://chunky.llbit.se/)

There is also a [Chunky subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/chunky)

This repository is maintained by acm321, AKA /u/SenpaiPleaseNoticeMe on Reddit.

*Currently WIP!*

To contribute, submit a pull request. I'll take anything that isn't already covered in this guide so long as it's not total shite.

Right now, everything is just on one page. I ~~may switch~~ am currently switching the format to multiple pages. ~~in the future (one per tab, perhaps).~~

Todo: finish the main guide, provide example scenes for download, maybe videos?

## [Tab 1: General](General.md)

## [Tab 2: Lighting](Lighting.md)
  
## [Tab 3: Sky and Fog](Sky-fog.md)  

  
## Tab 4: Water

  The Water tab allows you to set water visibility (how many blocks deep can you see), opacity (how "thick" does it look), height, and color. You can also toggle Still Water (no waves) and Water World mode (surrounds the scene with an infinite ocean).
  
## Tab 5: Camera
