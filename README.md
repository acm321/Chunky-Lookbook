## Welcome to the Chunky Lookbook

*Currently WIP!*


## Tab 1: General

  The first tab of the render controls dialog is the "General" tab. It looks like this:

  On this tab you will find the main controls for rendering the scene itself, including the canvas size (resolution of the rendered picture), the Y clipping settings (for taking out a vertical "slice" of the scene"), and the Target SPP (what quality do you want to render to).
  
  At the top you'll find some buttons for scene operations (loading, saving, etc...) You can save and load render settings separately from the scene so that you could, for example, apply settings from one scene to a different one. You can also load the chunks you've selected in the main window and completely reload the scene from here.
  
  You can toggle player loading and biome colors on this page as well.
  
## Tab 2: Lighting

  This tab contains the lighting settings, including the intensity of the sky, emitter, and sun lights. You can also toggle emitter and sunlight here, and change the azimuth, alititude, and color of the sunlight.
  
## Tab 3: Sky and Fog

  This tab allows you to set the sky mode, cloud settings, and fog settings.
  
## Tab 4: Water

  The Water tab allows you to set water visibility (how many blocks deep can you see), opacity (how "thick" does it look), height, and color. You can also toggle Still Water (no waves) and Water World mode (surrounds the scene with an infinite ocean).
  
## Tab 5: Camera
