## Welcome to the Chunky Lookbook

Chunky is made by llbit (praise be unto Him). Here is the [main Chunky website](http://chunky.llbit.se/)

There is also a [Chunky subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/chunky)

This repository is maintained by acm321, AKA /u/SenpaiPleaseNoticeMe on Reddit.

*Currently WIP!*

### FAQ:

**How can I contribute to this project?**

To contribute, submit a pull request. I'll take anything that isn't already covered in this guide so long as it's not total shite.

**How is this guide formatted?**

Right now, each tab of the Render Controls dialog gets its own page which details the settings therein. This could change in the future if people want it to.

**Why are you doing this when there's official documentation already on the Chunky website?**

Because the official documentation is extremely outdated, incomplete, and frankly, ~~totally sucks~~ is borderline useless due to having almost no examples.

**Do you believe in giraffes?**

No. How could such stupidly long horses even exist? Ridiculous, if you ask me.


### ToDo:
* Finish the main guide

* Add a gallery of example renders with their settings available for download 

* ???

* ~~Profit!~~ Seize the means of production

## Index:

Clicl one of the links below to see the documentation for each tab!

### [Tab 1: General](General.md)

### [Tab 2: Lighting](Lighting.md)
  
### [Tab 3: Sky and Fog](Sky-fog.md)  

### Tab 4: Water

  The Water tab allows you to set water visibility (how many blocks deep can you see), opacity (how "thick" does it look), height, and color. You can also toggle Still Water (no waves) and Water World mode (surrounds the scene with an infinite ocean).
  
### Tab 5: Camera
