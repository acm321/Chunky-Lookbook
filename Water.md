### Water Visibility:

  This controls how far you can see through the water. Here is our reference, with the default of 9:

  Here it is turned all the way down to 0:

### Water Opacity:

  This controls how transparent the water is. I've chosen a different color to make the effect more visible. The default setting is 0.42:

  Here it is at zero. Notice how even though the water is totally clear, you still can't see any further down than in the previous picture because the visibility setting hasn't been changed:

  And finally at the maximum setting of 1:
