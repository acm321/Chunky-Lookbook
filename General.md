## Tab 1: General
 
  The first tab of the render controls dialog is the "General" tab. It looks like this:

  On this tab you will find the main controls for rendering the scene itself, including the canvas size (resolution of the rendered picture) and the Y clipping settings (for taking out a vertical "slice" of the scene").
  
  At the top you'll find some buttons for scene operations (loading, saving, etc...) You can save and load render settings separately from the scene so that you could, for example, apply settings from one scene to a different one. You can also load the chunks you've selected in the main window and completely reload the scene from here.
  
  You can toggle player loading and biome colors on this page as well.
