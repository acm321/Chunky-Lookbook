## Tab 5: Camera

### Presets

There are a number of preset camera angles available. These should be fairly self explanatory:

Here is one of the isometric presets, which uses the parallel projection mode (more on that in a bit):

### Cameras

Chunky has the ability to switch between multiple cameras. The default is simply one camera named "camera 1". By pressing the "Clone" button, you can create additional cameras. Each camera retains its own settings and you can switch between them using the drop-down menu:

The Position & Orientation box does exactly what is says on the tin. The third box in Orientation allows you to rotate the camera perpendicularly to the camera axis:

The "Camera to player" button moves the selected camera to the location of the player, if available.

The "Center camera" button places the camera in the center of the scene.

### Projection mode:

Chunky has several projection modes available:

The default is "Standard". It looks something like this:

Parallel produces an isometric view, as seen above.

Fisheye looks like... a fisheye lens:

Stereographic produces this distorion effect:

There are two panorama modes: Equirectangular...

... and Slot:

Lastly, there are two modes for creating stereo pairs of images, one for the left-eye image and one for the right-eye image. Cross your eyes so that the images below line up to see the resulting 3d effect:

## FoV, DoF, Subject Distance:

Field of view allows you to zoom in and out. You can type anything into the box even if it exceeds the bounds of the slider. A lower FoV zooms the camera in...:

... and a higher FoV zooms it out:

The Depth of field setting changes... the depth of field. A smaller DoF leaves only a thin "slice" in focus...:

... whereas a large enough DoF puts everything in focus:

Subject Distance changes the point at which the camera's focus is centered. You can easily focus on a certain distance by pointing the cursor at the desired block and pressing "Autofocus". You can then set the DoF to your liking.

Here is a low DoF at two different subject distances; one is close to the camera, and the other far away:
