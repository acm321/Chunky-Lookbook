**Note:** Changing these settings can be done mid-render without having to reset. The changes will appear on the next rendered frame.

**Exposure** determines how bright everything is, just like adjusting the exposure length of a camera. Here's our reference, with an exposure of 1:

**Postprocessing mode** allows you to choose between several general "looks" for the exposure of the render.

Here is no postprocessing:
